    'The purpose of the review is not to make assessment “AI-proof”, nor to identify where AI should simply be prohibited. Instead, it supports programme teams to consider whether their curriculum and assessment approaches remain intentional, coherent, authentic and resilient in an AI-enabled environment.',

    'potential AI-related vulnerabilities;',
    'opportunities for meaningful AI integration;',
